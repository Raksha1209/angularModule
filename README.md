# Angular Fundamentals-
  I've learned that Angular is a powerful frontend framework that uses components to build the UI and modules to organize them. Explored routing, where <router-outlet> loads components based on the URL, and how to define routes with both static and dynamic paths (like about/:id). I now understood dependency injection (DI), which lets Angular automatically provide services (like ActivatedRoute or Router) to components. I've seen the difference between Router (for navigation) and ActivatedRoute (for reading route data(current route)), and used both to build interactive routes. I've learned about lazy loading using loadComponent to optimize performance by loading components only when needed. 

  Finally,explored modern features like standalone components, zoneless apps, and how to structure Angular projects for enterprise-ready applications.
